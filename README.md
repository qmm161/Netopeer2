**Netopeer2** is a set of tools implementing network configuration tools based
on the NETCONF Protocol. This is the second generation of the toolset, originally
available as the [Netopeer project](https://github.com/CESNET/netopeer). Netopeer2
is based on the new generation of the NETCONF and YANG libraries -
[libyang](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang) and [libnetconf2](https://github.com/CESNET/libnetconf2).
The Netopeer server uses [sysrepo](https://github.com/sysrepo/sysrepo) as a NETCONF
datastore implementation.

**Netopeer2** is maintained and further developed by the [Tools for
Monitoring and Configuration](https://www.liberouter.org/) department of
[CESNET](http://www.ces.net/). Any feedback, testing or feature requests are welcome.
Please contact us via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CESNET/Netopeer2/issues).

## Current State
- **CLI** - simple command line interface to connect to a NETCONF server (device).
- **server** - NETCONF server with a modular datastore allowing interconnection and control of
  various applications.
